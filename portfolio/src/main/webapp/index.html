                "Hi, everyone! It is great to have you here! My name is Bernardo Eilert Trevisan and I am currently 20 years old. 
                I was born in a city located in the south of Brazil called Porto Alegre. I lived there with my parents and my brother until I graduated from High School.
                After that, I moved to Connecticut to begin my undergraduate studies at Yale University. As of today, I am a rising junior majoring in 
                Computer Science. I am extremely excited to be working as a STEP intern for Google this Summer and cannot wait to see this portfolio grow 
                as I make my way through the upcoming projects."
